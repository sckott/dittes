* descriptive stats on data
  * to summary
    * add avg. by transect by year
* actual analysis of data, ANOVA, etc.
  * compre among transects?
  * compare among soil types?
  * compare among years within sites?
* Shiny stuff
  * Layers
    * Soil w/ metadata for rainfall, other things?
    * shape file w/ polygons for slope classes (daubenmire scale)
    * Vegetation layers (just woodland and grassland)
    * Data points for transects
  * Selecting polygons based on lb/sq ft & soil types & slopes
    * which navigates to certain polygon on map

* Hours
  * 20 hrs to do initial work, then another 20 to modify, upkeep
  * 40 hrs X $40/hr = $1600


# Notes on 2014-10-06

* Main Questions (reseponse: RDM):
  * 1st: Among transects (either within year or just avg years)
  * 2nd: Soil (same as "soil" var have now)
* Descriptive stats for all possible groups, each transect alone in each year
* Do power analysis if possible:
  * desired effect size:
  * certainty: 95%?
  * they're most interested at the "pasture level" - so more transects and plots at each site

# Notes on 2014-11-09

* RDM data is in grams (g), convert to lbs/sq acre by multiply numbers in RMD column by 100
* Woodland/Grassland column: 1's: grassland, 3's woodland
* desc stats for each transect
* anova - 
  * differences btw soil types
  * within each transect between years
* power analysis, detect ~ 10% difference, or %15 difference
*
